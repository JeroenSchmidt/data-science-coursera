[TOC]

Goal of this course: - it will focus on the first 3 steps
***Raw Data -> Processing Script -> tidy data*** -> data analysis -> data communication 



## Raw and Processed Data

> ***Data:*** Data are values of qualitative or quantitative variables, belonging to a set of items.

* *Set of items:* Sometimes called the **population**; the set of objects you are interested in.
* *Variables*: A measurement or characteristic of an item
* *Qualitative:* Country of origin, sex, treatment
* *Quantitative:* Height weight, blood pressure

**Raw data**

* Original source of data
* Hard to use for data analyses
* Data analysis includes processing
* Raw data may need to be processed once

**Processed data**

* Data that is ready for analysis 
* Processing can include merging, subseting, transforming, etc
* There may be standards for processing
* All steps should be recorded 

==NOTE== Be aware of possible artifacts that are created from your data processing 

## Tidy Data

**The 4 things you should have once you've produced your tidy data:**

* The raw data
* A tidy data set
* A code book describing each variable and its values in the tidy data set
* *An explicit and exact recipe you used to go from 1-> 2,3* (==very important==)

### Raw Data

1. Ran no software on the data
2. Did not manipulate any of the numbers in the data
3. You did not remove any data from the data set
4. You did not summarize the data in any way
